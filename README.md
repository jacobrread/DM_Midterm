# Midterm

## Problem 1
Start by solving the vanilla problem and then add the complexity (50%, etc) as you go

### For just 50%:
I ran 10000 experiments and got 31% stopping point and 27% stopping point
I ran 100000 experiments and got 34% stopping point

 How does this compare with the simple early-stopping problem?
 - The curve flattens out more

### For 20% and increasing
I ran 10000 experiments and got the following:
- Optimal Search Threshold: 30.0%
- Optimal Answer: 859

I did it again and got the following:
- Optimal Search Threshold: 30.0%
- Optimal Answer: 227

When I ran 100000 experiments I got the following:
- Optimal Search Threshold: 35.0%
- Optimal Answer: 592.757226505516

Optimal Search Threshold: 34.0%
Optimal Answer: 968.1729270627526

Optimal Search Threshold: 35.0%
Optimal Answer: 560.6912085494506



## Problem 2
The one that has the highest average is the one you should converge too

How many days will it take for you to make the decision to place the permanent sensor?
Also, state the area that you select as the optimum.



## Problem 3
Don't forget the price of the option is the current stock price - the time to exercise (or the strike)



## General Tips
Dr. Mario said that if you cannot figure something out, experiment yourself and add a different complexity. Solve it,
and explain it in either the readme or the code comments
